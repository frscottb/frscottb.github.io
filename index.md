# Monastery Dropout
This page is for people who wanted to become monks, nuns, consecrated religous, but for one reason or another, were unable to "persevere."

## Possible Reasons

- You had some physical illness that made it impossible to live the life.

- You had some psychological difficulty or mental illness that made it difficult to live the live.

- You were too traditional or conservative for the particular order or community you attempted to join.

- You were unable to accept separation from close family members: mother, father, grandparents, etc.

- You were dismissed for  actual or perceived moral failure.

- You could never find an order to accept you.

- You could never find an order or community that seemed to fit you.


## You still desire religious life?

It is possible that you will never find your place in an official religious order. Maybe you are now married, widowed, or divorced. It is still possible for us, who are Monastery Dropouts to embrace a life of total consecration to God, in whatever state of life we find ourselves.

And we can strive to "approximate" the monastic life in so far as is possible for our current situation.

## This might include:

- extended periods of daily prayer

- fasting and abstinence from certain kinds of food (veganism, vegetarianism, no alcohol, etc.)

- physical asceticism: sleeping on the floor or a hard bed, doing manual labor, prostrations, praying with arms extended, etc.

- memorization of religious texts

- a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule for "works of mercy" or "mercy ministry", feeding the poor, homeless ministry, pro-life activism, etc.

- serious spiritual direction, where obedience is part of the equation, as opposed to simply getting spiritual advice.

## Getting Support

In order to authentically embrace the life, we need support. I hope in the future to set up some kind of forum, email list, blog, or other means of communicating with other "in the world monastics" and sharing ideas and advice with each other. If you might be interested in this, please drop me a line at frscottb@gmail.com.
